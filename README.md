# AI-based-Generative-QA-System-Public-Code-Issues-Pull-requests-Actions-Proj
Project overview: This project is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in working with generative text systems using GPT models. It involves two distinct yet interconnected tasks: Email Subject Line Generation and Question Answering on AIML Queries. Participants will gain practical exposure to key aspects of generative NLP, including dataset curation, model fine-tuning, implementation, and deployment.
Tasks: 
1. Email Subject Line Generation
Objective: Generate concise and meaningful email subject lines by abstracting the most salient sentences from the email body.
Key Highlights:
Focus on an uncommon text generation task that differs from traditional headline or news summarization.
Fine-tune any GPT-2 variant model for the task.
Learn to evaluate the quality of text generation using various metrics.
Outcome: A fine-tuned generative model capable of producing concise email subject lines.
2. Question Answering on AIML Queries
Objective: Develop a domain-specific GPT model fine-tuned to answer questions related to the AIML course.
Key Highlights:
Curate a new, domain-relevant dataset tailored for AIML queries.
Fine-tune the model to enhance its expertise in the AIML domain.
Test the model's performance on unseen, related questions.
Outcome: A trained QA model capable of producing accurate, context-specific answers for AIML queries
Technologies Used
Language Models: GPT-2 and T5.
Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.
Deployment:Streamlit.
